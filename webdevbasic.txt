THERE ARE 3 TYPES OF Cascading style sheet
Inline, Internal and External CSS

Inline is used inside the opening tag of the element. used to style particular elements. and can be used anywhere in html document.
Internal css have opening and closing styling tags - <style></style>
External css uses refering link to the CSS file <link href="style.css" />

Internal tags are used inside the style tags and elements which are needed to be styled are mentioned.
example =    <style> h1,h2,footer{
            background: burlywood;
        }</style>
and these mentioned tags are called Selectors. here selectors are h1, h2 and footer
Internal css can be applied anywhere in Html document and it is limited to one html document only.

in external css, external css file needed with extension style.css and a refering link.
for example -
inside the head element-
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet"
      href="./style.css" />
</head>
where rel is relationship.
href means where the file located.

class selector = starts with .red-heading -- class is an attribute. mainly used to style particular element and used inline.
for example = <h1 class="red-text"> heading 2 </h1>
<p class="red-text">Paragraph</p>
and in style.css -- .red-text{color:red; }
it is used multipage website with lots of different elements.
id selector: 
syntax = #main{color:red} where pound sign is used.
it is used to apply to the element having that id attribute in it.
for example - <h2 id="main">Red</h2>
<h2>Green</h2>
<h2>Black</h2>

css -  #main{color: red;}
it will the text red in only in element having id main.

class selector is applied to many elements but id selector is applied to a particular element or one element, there will be one id of paricular name.
id are unique, only one element per file.
